This file was built over the course of an afternoon in 2001 by Dame Hex. Currently there are about 85 characters: full uppercase and lowercase registers, numerals and basic punctuation, math, and internet symbols. If updates exist, they are at http://www.emeraldrain.com/fm/content/goreyttf.html

A kind soul named Daniel Steinberg has reconditioned the file to work properly with OSX. Thanks!

Any comments/suggestions, please feel free to contact dame@emeraldrain.com

Please distribute only as part of this .zip file. Thanks!
