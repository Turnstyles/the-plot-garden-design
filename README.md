# The Plot Garden
An online mystery storytelling game

non-realtime

When setting up the game you can choose between telling the story via text and images, or video. 

You can end up with a small book or a video of a story being told based on that choice

Use the small book dimentions to determine layouts and media sizes.

Really good ones (by plot and by rating) can be highlighted and possibly even sold on RPGTheater

## V1

To begin with, V1 is just populated with the original Dark Cults content which is there to just demonstrate the mechanics until we can create our own sets of rules and content. The goal is really to provide an interface for inventing new games like dark cults, not just to put dark cults online.

2 players 

on a turn you draw a card, then can a play narrative card.
Then you either write, or upload a video to flesh out the story


Technical design note: If you don't have a card you can play (maybe you don't have one that matches the sequence) perhaps you can draw a second card?
Or consider that the player can choose the deck to draw from or that the computer makes sure that the player draws something that they can play (for good or bad). 
If so, then when creating story arcs, have the designer choose probability distributions and ranges for cards in their story arc


## V2 

Maybe 1-4 players

The ability when setting up the hosting parameters to choose 
  - A Story Type (Murder Mystery, Lovecraftian, Gothic Horror)
  - Plots - where dark cults is a 2 person plot called "life vs death" 
  - Story Arcs (allowable card sequences - small and large, subplots or not)
  - Plot Elements
  - Characters Art or Media Elements (Soundscapes and other sound types for each card type)
  - Additional Deck Types (ethical playground)

After choosing the hosting options, the person can invite a friend
do a search for others based on criteria with a matchmaking function
or browse other peoples stories on RPGTheater.com and use that to choose who to invite

We will probably experiment with different kinds of story elements, card types 
and narrative arcs created with allowable sequences of them.

The ability for contributors to create story arcs, card types, cards and upload sets of media elements

## V3 

Add a map

on a turn you can move or do other commands (search, hide), 
 
In addition to the basic story sequence rules you can explore locations on the map
Doing so can unlock additional plots in the form of different cards in the main deck
add different decks to those available or add other locations to explore
