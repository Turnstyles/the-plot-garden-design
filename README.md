# the-plot-garden
An online mystery storytelling game

To begin with, Dark Cults with a map

Non-Realtime
Story Oriented

Maybe 1-4 players, maybe 1-4 characters, time will tell
 
In addition to the basic dark cults rules you can explore locations on the map
Doing so can unlock additional plots in the form of different cards in the main deck
or add other locations to explore

We will probably experiment with different kinds of story elements, card types 
and narrative arcs created with allowable sequences of them.

Ducats

Possibly one person pays $10 for a group of 1-4 to play for about 3 months
eventually the plot comes to a conclusion, but if they want to keep going 
they can as long as they want but things are naturally a little throttled 
by the existing content, and artwook, but if they are in full on write mode 
they can keep going

Eventually new story options, cards, decks and dynamics might come out 
then they might want to purchase them to start up a new plot in the same story

Or they might want to start a new story with new characters and pay another $10
