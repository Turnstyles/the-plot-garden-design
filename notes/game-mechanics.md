# General Mechanics:

- Is this a role-playing game or a god-playing game? It's a question of a first-person close "psychic distance," with a camera that only sees what the character can see, versus third person distant, with a camera that can see whatever it wants.

- Important to make imagined scene-layout clear but not overelaborate.

- Alternate between letting the player shape the story path and forcing the player down a randomized story path based on card draw?

- Each card has two phases/two necessary actions: When drawn or played onto the board, it is introduced into the story. When exercised/tapped/removed/played, that element must be resolved.

- Certain cards pulled or played in the beginning are kept in special board-places as the pillars of the internal and external plot, or something like that. In a madlibby style, they are shoehorned into each scene so that the writer has to mention how they are utilized/affected. Maybe sometimes, randomly, they are skipped! Or maybe more loosely define these two cards as "poles of energy". One is the north magnetic pole, one is the south magnetic pole. This creates a kind of profluence and interactivity but leaves it more open/evocative and has a cool arcane architectural framing.

- “[The writer’s] job is to give readers stress, strain, and pressure. The fact is that readers who hate those things in life love them in fiction..." In favor of a death-like dark cults antagonistic role

- Incentive for playing two cards at a time instead of the typical one? Simple challenge to check off more keywords in the same amount of text?

- Important to the appeal of the game will be lots and lots of different cards so maybe we shouldn't make illustrations for them in the first version of the game, maybe just make a few cool card layout designs/backgrounds and reuse those a lot and focus on writing cool text descriptions!

- Exploring new rooms on the map lets you find more cards than what's in your hand, but you have to put them immediately into play.

- For the most part, we want the story to be chronologically told, but with special rare exceptions like: Flashback card: Special card: can be played in concert with any card that was played by ANOTHER PLAYER SINCE YOUR LAST TURN—specify your own chronology that can be any time in the past: during the story as currently told or before it started. Then take your turn and treat your Flashback card as a copy of the specified card played by the other player, except with your new timeframe.

- Compost: When players feel a card has finished its arc in the story, it is put into the Compost. At any time, a player may trade a card in their hand for a card in the Compost, and re-introduce it into the story.

- Trading: Players may designate certain cards in their hand to remain visible. A 1-for-1 trade for a visible card can be proposed at any time. This may not be the only reason you elect to keep some cards visible—perhaps you want other players to build up to a card you plan to play.

# Considerations/Prompts/Limitations for Player-Written-passages:

- Precise and significant DETAILS are the lifeblood of all storytelling! Something in the writing template that forces writer to generate them.

- Force/emphasize process of writerly selection. Prompt: select the two most important objects in the room. Select the most important sound that is heard during an action.

- Strict Text Limit on each turn (or each action in a turn?)! Forces economy of craft, and a limit makes it less daunting for some people!

- The element that doesn't belong is often the most significant and should be pursued (a parakeet in the corner of a very traditional nightmare). How does this factor in to a random hand of cards?

- Each story chunk should end in Hemingway fashion, meaning it is not a clean end, leaves clear path to the next day/next chunk.

- Make them emphasize nouns and verbs, not adjectives.

- Give them compound sentence connectors? Additive: "but, and, or". Subordinating: "thus, so"

- List the senses, make the writer pay tribute to a few of them, not just sight. Ursula le Guin says: "Sound, above all, is evocative"

- Prompt-type for imbuing everyday descriptions with atmosphere/psychic meaning: “Describe a barn as seen by a man whose son has just been killed in a war. Do not mention the son, or war, or death. Do not mention the man who does the seeing.”

- Prompts to remind the reader of the wider physical world, not just the character's bubble.
