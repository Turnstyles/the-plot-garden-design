# Beginnings of a Story:

- Type 1: Moment of Change (a stranger comes to town, a character is misbehaving/has misbehaved, a character returns ← these are all more indicitive of novelistic forms. Traditional in medias res is more suitable for short forms?)

- Type 2: Internal Conflict—Functions as an internal, one-character in medias res. Usually involves habitual action, and no inciting incident, but a feeling of change on the horizon.

- Type 3: Mystery—invokes hermeneutic suspense. Often involves an element unfamiliar to the world of the reader. However, should not overwhelm the reader with difference, lest it feel like a mess rather than a mystery.

# Character-Generation:

- What is the last thing they would do in _blank_ situation?

- How do others treat them? Queen effect.

- Essences: What kind of smoke are you? (cw: choose 5 adjectives to describe different attributes of yourself, a fey creature asks you to tell a story about your childhood and will reward you for a good one).

- “Thus plot not only changes but creates character: By our actions we discover what we really believe and, simultaneously, reveal ourselves to others. And setting influences both character and plot: One cannot do in a thunderstorm what one does on a hot day in Jordan.” Plot/char/setting all tied together. Use action/setting as tangible things to force the writer to create character bit by bit.

- No backstory at the beginning, give evocative maybe physical features/situation, and let each successive action build the character.

# Plot types:

- Core: Character's desire → comes with: urgency, agency, psychology that creates drive, easy obstacles → results in: achieve, don't achieve, realize false desire.

- Core: Character's choice → comes with: action → must have: obstacles, an even weight between both sides → results in: choice made

- Connections and Disconnections

- Escalations and Reversals

- Core Tension and Local Tensions that are spawned from the core tension but resolve or dissapate

- The process of funneling down alternatives. The character begins with many possible paths, and they are each scratched-out one by one.

# In Each Scene:

- Intention and Obstacle, once you have that down it creates itself

- Both inner and outer forces pressing the character toward an action, both inner and outer forces pressing against that action

- Every scene should provide some change to the internal or external plot, or else what's the point.

- Mamet: A scene should contain an attempt of the hero to reach a goal, and should answer three questions: 1. Who wants what from whom? 2. What happens if they don't get it? 3. Why now?

# Types of suspense:

- Hermeneutic: Unanswered questions — Detective/mystery

- Proairetic: Anticipation of resolution of an impending or already-begun action — Action/thriller

- They are separated by location in time: Hermeneutic: entering a murder scene after everyone but the victim has left, vs. Proairetic: entering a murder scene when a man pulls out a gun

# Misc:

- Dialogue should: reveal character, reveal plot, provide backstory, provide exposition, reveal emotion (reconceptualize these?), all dialogue should do at least two (is this true?)

- “a sentence is an organization of items in the world; and a sentence is a structure of logical relationships”

- On the level of the sentence, understanding its form and making substitutions within those forms is the road to creativity and meaning.

- Sharp, percussive end to each paragraph.
