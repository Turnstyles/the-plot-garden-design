# Considerations/Prompts/Limitations for Player-Written-passages:

- Precise and significant DETAILS are the lifeblood of all storytelling! Something in the writing template that forces writer to generate them.

- Force/emphasize process of writerly selection. Prompt: select the two most important objects in the room. Select the most important sound that is heard during an action.

- Strict Text Limit on each turn (or each action in a turn?)! Forces economy of craft, and a limit makes it less daunting for some people!

- The element that doesn't belong is often the most significant and should be pursued (a parakeet in the corner of a very traditional nightmare). How does this factor in to a random hand of cards?

- Each story chunk should end in Hemigway fashion, meaning it is not a clean end, leaves clear path to the next day/next chunk.

- Make them emphasize nouns and verbs, not adjectives.

- Give them compound sentence connectors? Additive: "but, and, or". Subordinating: "thus, so"

- List the senses, make the writer pay tribute to a few of them, not just sight. Ursula le Guin says: "Sound, above all, is evocative"

- Prompt-type for imbuing everyday descriptions with atmosphere/psychic meaning: “Describe a barn as seen by a man whose son has just been killed in a war. Do not mention the son, or war, or death. Do not mention the man who does the seeing.”

- Prompts to remind the reader of the wider physical world, not just the character's bubble.

# General Mechanics:

- Is this a role-playing game or a god-playing game? It's a question of a first-person close "psychic distance," with a camera that only sees what the character can see, versus third person distant, with a camera that can see whatever it wants.

- Important to make imagined scene-layout clear but not overelaborate.

- Alternate between letting the player shape the story path and forcing the player down a randomized story path based on card draw?

- Each card has two phases/two necessary actions: When drawn or played onto the board, it is introduced into the story. When exercised/tapped/removed/played, that element must be resolved.

- Certain cards pulled or played in the beginning are kept in special board-places as the pillars of the internal and external plot, or something like that. In a madlibby style, they are shoehorned into each scene so that the writer has to mention how they are utilized/affected. Maybe sometimes, randomly, they are skipped! Or maybe more loosely define these two cards as "poles of energy". One is the north magnetic pole, one is the south magnetic pole. This creates a kind of profluence and interactivity but leaves it more open/evocative and has a cool arcane architectural framing.

- “[The writer’s] job is to give readers stress, strain, and pressure. The fact is that readers who hate those things in life love them in fiction..." In favor of a death-like dark cults role

# In concert with Design/Visuals:

- I think the aesthetic should be very minimalist, largely black screen, almost inspired by text-based role playing games. This puts much more emphasis on imagination and leaves room for it. A more concrete aesthetic/visual design probably funnels the imagined possibilities and funnels the appeal.

# Beginnings of a Story:

- Type 1: Moment of Change (a stranger comes to town, a character is misbehaving/has misbehaved, a character returns ← these are all more indicitive of novelistic forms. Traditional in medias res is more suitable for short forms?)

- Type 2: Internal Conflict—Functions as an internal, one-character in medias res. Usually involves habitual action, and no inciting incident, but a feeling of change on the horizon.

Type 3: Mystery—invokes hermeneutic suspense. Often involves an element unfamiliar to the world of the reader. However, should not overwhelm the reader with difference, lest it feel like a mess rather than a mystery.

# Charater-Generation:

- What is the last thing they would do in _blank_ situation?

- How do others treat them? Queen effect.

- Essences: What kind of smoke are you?

- “Thus plot not only changes but creates character: By our actions we discover what we really believe and, simultaneously, reveal ourselves to others. And setting influences both character and plot: One cannot do in a thunderstorm what one does on a hot day in Jordan.” Plot/char/setting all tied together. Use action/setting as tangible things to force the writer to create character bit by bit.

- No backstory at the beginning, give evocative maybe physical features/situation, and let each successive action build the character.

# Plot types:

- Core: Character's desire → comes with: urgency, agency, psychology that creates drive, easy obstacles → results in: achieve, don't achieve, realize false desire.

- Core: Character's choice → comes with: action → must have: obstacles, an even weight between both sides → results in: choice made

- Connections and Disconnections

- Escalations and Reversals

- Core Tension and Local Tensions that are spawned from the core tension but resolve or dissapate

- The process of funneling down alternatives. The character begins with many possible paths, and they are each scratched-out one by one.

# In Each Scene:

- Intention and Obstacle, once you have that down it creates itself

- Both inner and outer forces pressing the character toward an action, both inner and outer forces pressing against that action

- Every scene should provide some change to the internal or external plot, or else what's the point.

- Mamet: A scene should contain an attempt of the hero to reach a goal, and should answer three questions: 1. Who wants what from whom? 2. What happens if they don't get it? 3. Why now?

# Types of suspense:

- Hermeneutic: Unanswered questions — Detective/mystery

- Proairetic: Anticipation of resolution of an impending or already-begun action — Action/thriller

- They are separated by location in time: Hermeneutic: entering a murder scene after everyone but the victim has left, vs. Proairetic: entering a murder scene when a man pulls out a gun

# Misc:

- Dialogue should: reveal character, reveal plot, provide backstory, provide exposition, reveal emotion (reconceptualize these?), all dialogue should do at least two (is this true?)

- “a sentence is an organization of items in the world; and a sentence is a structure of logical relationships”

- On the level of the sentence, understanding its form and making substitutions within those forms is the road to creativity and meaning.

- Sharp, percussive end to each paragraph.
