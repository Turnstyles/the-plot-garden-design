# Visual Design

- I think the aesthetic should be very minimalist, largely black screen, almost inspired by text-based role playing games. This puts much more emphasis on imagination and leaves room for it. A more concrete aesthetic/visual design probably funnels the imagined possibilities and funnels the appeal.

# Setting/Scenario

- Ken Rahman on the card art: "The scenes depicted had to be somewhat related so as not to disorient players with radical shifts of setting: an urban setting seemed the most adaptable to most story types so things commonly found in these environs were acceptable. The urban environment was also what most people would be acquainted with and could yield a wealth of personal experiences to incorporate as details."

- Random idea: The setting is a mysterious and possibly cursed hotel, with many rooms and many residents. This allows a lot of different story types, and draws on a Clue-like tradition. In the back of the hotel is the Garden: this is the only special room. When the protagonist ventures out to the Garden is when a special end card is drawn and must be incorporated. The ending condition may be one of the harder mechanics to tweak about this game. Maybe players will be at odds with each other, having a fight where one player keeps moving the protagonist toward the Garden and another player keeps moving him away.

- Other way to build around the game's name: the Garden is not actually where the story takes place, just a mystical plane where the storytellers, magical entities of some kind, gather around and build up their metaphorical story-plants for all to see.
