# Card Sequencing

Be a little more flexible with our version, though. When players draw the card, they can select the type from amongst a few native choices to that card. This is a good mechanic, the type of thing you want: it adds a skill/planning element to the game, without contrived numbers/victory conditions.

# P (Pace cards, special)

## (If a card is followed by PACE, that means it MUST be followed by a Pace card before one of the other options)

# Start

## (special card, played at beginning of round not during)

## (followed by, A, D, L, T)

Examples: "That night, upon leaving the old, rumor-ridden brick house"—"Something beckons you from the comfort of your home out into the night"—"The clock warns of the late hour and ends this night's stroll"—"An overwhelming and troubled sleep ends the night's adventure"

# A (atmosphere, not necessarily setting, often just evocative feelings/phrases)

## (followed by: PACE, A, D, L, T)

## (0 Life 0 Death—little impact, just for flavor and low-impact cards to cycle through)
