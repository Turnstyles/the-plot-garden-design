## Pellikoi:

In the course of play, the heroes may come across a PROBLEM/OBSTACLE do not know how to solve. Perhaps it's a sheer cliff face that needs to be scaled, an indefatigable beast that really needs to be fatigued, but whatever the reason it might be a good time to use a spirit card. Look at the TAGS on your cards, these are clues to the players to help you think about the spirits you can invoke this session.

## Once Upon a Time:

You get a hand full of story cards and one special Ending. It's not collaborative, your goal is to tell your story in sequence, and run out of cards in your end, working towards your Ending and ultimately getting to play the Ending in a way that makes sense. There are also Interrupt cards—when another player says the story-word on the interrupt card, you play it to jump in and continue telling their story with your own cards, it's not theirs anymore.

It seems like having one single randomly-drawn ending forces you to put a different mood/genre-spin on your story each playthrough, and thus makes each playthrough different.

## Dixit:

One player is the storyteller for the turn and looks at the images on the 6 cards in her hand. From one of these, she makes up a sentence and says it out loud (without showing the card to the other players).

Each other player selects the card in their hands which best matches the sentence and gives the selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to the others.

The storyteller shuffles her card with all the received cards. All pictures are shown face up and every player has to bet upon which picture was the storyteller's.

If nobody or everybody finds the correct card, the storyteller scores 0, and each of the other players scores 2. Otherwise the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer score 3. Players score 1 point for every vote for their own card.

## Fog of Love:

Interesting and unique one. Not really what we're currently looking for, but good to keep in mind. A role-playing game in the strictest sense of the word, where you make choices based on the personality that you've laid out for yourself. They seem to do a good job of gamifying elements of relationships and storytelling—you have a destiny/goal of a certain balance of "traits" within the relationship, and each event gives you an opportunity to develop or tear down current traits of your character and of the relationship. They do a good job of corresponding these personality traits to concrete storytelling actions/responses. A different kind of game, but an interesting kind to consider.
