    has many cards

code is the short name or label of the Card type and can be used for an icon
code should consist only of lowercase letters, numbers and dashes

card_types and cards are just a set of id's

card_types possibilities determine the grammar

The demo game of Dark Cults like is an example of a deck
it's name is Life vs Death and has 2 profiles which are players

    possibilities

code is the short name or label of the Card type
for example the code for Start might be S in some instances
the code can also be used as the filename for any icon
so the icon for start in the above example would be s.png
code should consist only of lowercase letters, numbers and dashes


possibilities are a set of cards that are permissible after this card type
for example using names
start -> location, object, atmosphere, event-1
or using codes instead of names
S -> L, O, A, E1

In future versions, possibilities might become much more advanced and have story arcs, sub-plots and the like

    code should consist only of lowercase letters, numbers and dashes

    face and backface are for images and should consist only of lowercase letters, numbers and dashes

    for example an atmosphere card could use the x field to put the filename of an audio clip to play with it

    In future versions x will be replaced by a more formal way of extending CardTypes and Cards by deck creators
