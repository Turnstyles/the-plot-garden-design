# Dark Cults: oCCult Edition

**Dark Cults** is a game from the early 80s by Kenneth Rahman, published by **Dark House**. It is out-of-print and mostly forgotten.

It is a story-telling game; a little like an RPG without the game master.

In **Dark Cults**, one player takes on the role as DEATH and the other player takes on the role of LIFE. They compete by spinning a tale, as dictated by the cards they play, in an attempt to either kill or save (respectively) the main character of their story.

## So What's the oCCult Edition?

**Dark Cults** is a fun and creative game, but being old and out-of-print, it is basically impossible to play. Sure, some people have scanned the cards and [posted them online](http://darkcults.homestead.com/), but they are low-resolution and pretty heavy on ink. So this is a print-and-play edition of the game with:

* hastily re-designed cards based on the content of the original 1983 deck
* a few new cards for fun
* some minor changes to one or two original cards due to artwork availability
* the **Object** add-on deck from 1985
* a re-formatted rulebook combining and integrating the
  original 1983 rulebook with text from the 1985 add-on rulebook, plus the
  single-player and multi-player modes
* a new **oCCult Edition** rule variant which incorporates RPG elements into the storytelling


## License

The rules and text of the cards are copyrighted by Kenneth Rahman. I considered making a "clone" originally, but after some attempt at contacting Kenneth, and some thought about ethics, I decided it would be *more* respectful to admit that this is **Dark Cults** with mods rather than claim it's **The Shadoow oCCult** (or something like that) with oddly similar rules.
