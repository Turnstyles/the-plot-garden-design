So what are the ways in which we can fund this?

## Free Version

If we can find one decent sponsor with the right product that we believe in we might be able to make enough to pay for hosting costs to fund a free version while we flesh out some other options

## Main Goal

Possibly one person pays $10 for a group of 1-4 to play for about 3 months
eventually the plot comes to a conclusion, but if they want to keep going 
they can as long as they want but things are naturally a little throttled 
by the existing content, and artwook, but if they are in full on write mode 
they can keep going

When a story feels complete, the players can print hard copy books of it via a small press for themselves or to sell to others

Video based stories can go onto a new site called RPGTheater to be categorized, purchased, viewed and rated.

Eventually new story options, cards, decks and dynamics might come out 
then they might want to purchase them to start up a new plot in the same story

Or they might want to start a new story with new characters and pay another $10

## Marketplace

If we build a MVP with just 2 players and using dark cults as the example content.

Then we create an interface for artists and writers to come up with their own cards, decks, images and sound libraries

Then we can let folk sell their collections as components for others to work with

## Merch

If we create one good set of flagship cards and content, we can sell some t-shirts and mugs with character art.

It would be interesting to see if you can tell a short 5 card story on a shirt.

## Kickstarter

Dependent on the above but then we could have a kickstarter where the money would go to some particularly good artists and writers to flesh out the content.

(ps if we do this, add some money for lawyers and hire the creative content folk to look for any legal mistakes we have made to the terms)
